# File Compression
The purpose and use of file compression is to reduce the file size of one or multiple files to take up less disk space. I no longer have the svg graphic file but I have compressed files before and the result is that they can be reduced down to 50-90 percent of the original size which is very useful. 

# Python OOP
Shark itself has no real meaning to it, it is just the word being used to define the class but that word can be anything. The attributes and methods of the class itself though are the ability to define and create objects with. The purpose of a constructor is to intialize the object of a class. A class is a blueprint that will be used to code with while an object is the instance of the class. What it means to instantiate is that you set an object equal to the class in order to use it. 

# Object Oriented Concepts
Instantiated objects of the shark class are the names that are given to the sharks. An inheritance is when one class is able to be made out of another class. An example of this would be if I made a class called ocean then used the water class to make another class called shark. Encapsulation and abstraction relate to the shark class by being able to hide unwanted data (abstraction) and then hiding certain data within a unit to protect it from outside sources (encapsulation).
